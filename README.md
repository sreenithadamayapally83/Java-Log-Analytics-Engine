# Java-Log-Analytics-Engine
A Core Java data processing engine for system log analysis, implementing HashMap-based frequency counting and Complexity Analysis ($O(n)$)


## Overview
This project simulates a backend data processing engine designed to analyze large-scale system logs for frequency patterns and critical error detection.

## Key Features
* **Data Processing:** Efficiently parses log streams using the **Core Java** Collections framework.
* **Complexity Analysis:** Optimized for performance with **O(n) Time Complexity** and **O(k) Space Complexity**.
* **Object-Oriented Design (OOAD):** Implements a dedicated `LogEntry` class to ensure data encapsulation and modularity.
* **Error Detection:** Features automated logic to flag critical platform failures in real-time.






## Technical Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **Data Structures:** ArrayList, HashMap
* **Methodology:** Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
